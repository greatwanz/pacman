# pacman

Simple game of pacman, with pacman represented as a yellow spheres and ghosts represented by spheres of varying colours.
AI is very simplistic, ghosts choose a random valid direction to travel in at each intersection.

## Bug list:
* In rare cases, it's possible to cause pacman to stop between an intersection.
* In rare cases, the colour of a ghost doesn't change back after it has been eaten by pacman.
